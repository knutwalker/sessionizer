> [!WARNING]
> Very much a work in progress.
> As it is, it's probably only working for me.
> Configurability might come later.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows is not supported. Using WSL might work, though it is not tested.

### Via Cargo

#### Released version

```sh
cargo install sessionizer
```

#### Development version

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/knutwalker/sessionizer
```
